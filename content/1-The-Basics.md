Snagit offers **three capture modes**:
- All-in-One – All-in-one mode allows you to first select an area of your screen, then choose among capturing an image, recording a video, or capturing a panoramic scrolling image.  
- Image – Image capture allows you to capture an image based on your selection of the window size and effects.
- Video – Video capture allows you to capture a video based on your selection of the region or window and microphone and webcam on or off. 

Pressing the **_Capture_** button allows you to start a capture. 

From the **menu**, you can change the capture settings and preferences. Use *Help* if you have questions about using the program. 

**Capture settings** allow you to configurate settings to meet your capturing needs. 

**Presets** allow you to save and retrieve your commonly used capture modes with configured settings. 

**Editor** allows you to preview, edit, and share your captures.
