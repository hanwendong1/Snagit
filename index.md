As part of the GEER grant, the University of Idaho has secured a license to use TechSmithâ€™s SnagIt software for both Windows and MacOS computers for the next 3 years starting 1/25/2021. Snagit is a screen capture tool that lets you take images or videos of your computer screen. With features that allow you to edit, store, and share, SnagIt is suitable for anyone who need to convey information effectively with visuals such as screenshots or screencasts. 
This web resource is created for University of Idaho faculty and staff who assist in the creation of instructional material for courses. Please feel free to <a href = "mailto: hanwendong@uidaho.edu">contact me</a> if you have any questions about this website or Snagit. 

Please access the pre-recorded video for this workshop session below.
